# Digital Mapping for Humanists: A Cookbook

## Introduction

Maps, mapping, and spatial understanding are central to many current projects in the humanities. Too often, however, the tools and approaches that facilitate spatial knowledge are limited to GIS and data analysis most useful to scientists and social scientists. Humanities researchers and teachers bring a range of other concerns to spatial data: to work smoothly with historical maps from other spatial traditions, to work in languages other than English, to incorporate a range of media, and to represent ambiguity just to name a few issues.

> #### This open-access, collaboratively authored "cookbook" is dedicated to helping spatially-minded humanities scholars produce maximal research insight, pedagogical utility and suitability for public outreach.

## What is a mapping "cookbook"?

Culinary cookbooks offer recipes for making specific dishes. A tech or [programming "cookbook"](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Coding_Cookbook) is different than a reference manual or tutorial documentation in that it doesn't attempt to cover all aspects of a topic or tool or teach you the basics from the ground up. Rather it contains "recipes" to teach you the ingredients and steps necessary to make specific things.

This cookbook, created for a workshop on [Fostering Humanistic Tools for Digital Mapping](https://www.acm.edu/professional_development/project/104/fostering-humanistic-tools-for-digital-mapping) funded by the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, contains recipes for adapting existing digital mapping tools to better meet the needs of humanistic scholars. Participants share proven methods of navigating obstacles within existing mapping tools to produce effective humanities-based digital maps.
