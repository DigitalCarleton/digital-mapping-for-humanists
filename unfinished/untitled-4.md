# Labeling Maps: Hierarchies of Terms

## **Introduction**

As a prior step to making a map, you should consider what kinds of labels you will need: City names? Country names? Regional names? River‌ names? How many types or levels of information will you need? How will you distinguish one type of information from another? Font, size, color, and symbols can all be helpful tools.

Once you have your lists, you can decide whether they belong in different map layers \(see the discussion of uncertain locations\) or whether some labels would be better drawn on to the finished map in Adobe Illustrator or similar software in order to indicate places that have different kinds of geographical existence \(that GIS can’t conceptualize\).
