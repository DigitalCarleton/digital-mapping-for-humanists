# Embedding a Web App from ArcGis Online into your Website - STUB

## **Introduction**

You can build a map in ArcGIS Online for your own use and never share it with anyone. But if you _do_ want to share a map, and especially if you want to give your users some ability to toggle layers on and off, to filter data within the map, or do any spatial analysis of your data, you’ll need to create a WebApp - a process covered in another recipe \[link to it\]. Once your WebApp is finish, you can just generate a link to share via social media, or you can generate an embed code so that the WebApp can live on a website. This recipe includes instructions for this last option.

## **Ingredients**

ArcGIS Online subscription \(either free or institutional\)

A website within which to embed your WebApp

## **How to do it**

If you haven’t created a Web Application of your map yet, go to Share in the Map Viewer, and click “Create Web App.” Then, choose a Template and go to the Configure page.

If you’ve already created a Web Application, go into the details page and click “Configure App.”

Once you are in the Configure page, go to Options and, under “Share Tools” check the box that says “Add embed option to share dialog.” This allows an embed code to show up in the Web App when you click Share. You and any viewers can use this code to embed the Application into your website.

Now, your Application will look like this when you click on the Share button in the toolbar:

Copy and paste the embed code under “Embed Map” and format as above to embed into WordPress.
