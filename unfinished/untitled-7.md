# Mapping from Texts

## **Introduction**

**Outlines the problem the recipe is trying to fix or the goal of the technique being addressed.**

Understanding the full range of ways in which human beings have conceptualized space often requires using all the types of sources we have, as well as various approaches to analyzing those sources. We analyze visual representations of space \(including maps, paintings etc.\), performative and ritual representations of space, and very frequent written texts that express spatial concepts and experiences. How do you move from a textual evidence to a map without letting the map itself distort the cultural ideas of the originating culture?

## **Ingredients**

**What do you need to know or have set up in order to follow the recipe. An application installed, a plugin activated, familiarity with a certain programming language, etc.**

**Hints, callouts and or warnings can be highlighted here as necessary**

Text that is prepared for digital analysis. \[see handout on preparing text\]

Preparatory work to understand what types of places are in the text \(precise places? Loosely defined regions? Imaginary places?\). What is the hierarchy of the places you want to map, using what symbols? \[add information on symbols and hierarchy\] Some online text mining tools can help with this? \[do we want to mention Voyant here?\]
